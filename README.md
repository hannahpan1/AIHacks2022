# AIHacks2022 Police Education

This is a project that was developed under 24 hours focused on predicting the most common issues regarding the policing department.

The UI is under development and has yet to be integrated together. The Abuse of Authority graph uses linear regressions and machine learning to predict 
the growth of this issue in the future. The concept was to repeat this with several issues outlined in police reports and then publish the results
with the top 3 most probable issues we will face.
